# Kanban Board Challenge

This project is a Kanban Board application built with a client-server architecture. The client is a front-end application, and the server is a back-end API that handles data persistence and authentication. The project uses PostgreSQL as the database and is designed to manage tasks and tickets in a Kanban-style workflow.
